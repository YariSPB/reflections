What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git file is created. no commits though
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it allows to choose files to be commited. Since commit is one time operation, it is relevant to collects files into batch before comiting.
